\chapter{Preliminaries and Definitions}
In this chapter, we firstly introduced notation and definitions used throughout this thesis. We used it to make a formal description of the problem of cylindrical algebraic decomposition. And finally, we describe and define a more specific version of this problem, which is a layered algebraic sub-decomposition.
\section{Polynomial definition and its characteristics}
Firstly we formulate the definition of the univariate polynomial, and it's elementary characteristics.
\begin{definition}{Univariate polynomial of degree n}
over the ring $R$ is a function in the form:
\begin{align*}
p(x) =  \sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i;\ \ \  a_i \in R, a_n \neq 0 
\end{align*}
The elements $a_0, a_1 .. a_n$ are called the coefficients of the polynomial $p$. Especially the coefficient $a_0$ is called constant coefficient and $a_n$ leading coefficient of the polynomial $p$.
\newline\newline
The set of all polynomial over ring $R$ is called the ring of the polynomials over $R$, and we represent it with symbol $R[x]$.
\end{definition}


After defining univariate polynomial, we describe some naming of some characteristics of the polynomials. The specific cases of the polynomials, which we use overall thesis,  are zero, constant and irreducible polynomial.  
\begin{definition}
Polynomial $f$ is called \textbf{zero polynomial} if all its coefficient equals to zero. All other polynomials are then called non-zero polynomial.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Polynomials, which coefficient are all equal zero except the constant coefficient $a_0$ are called \textbf{constant polynomials}. All other polynomials are then called non-constant.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Polynomial $p \in R[x]$ is called \textbf{irreducible} if $p$ is not constant and is not equal to product of two non-constant polynomials from ring $R[x]$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Root of polynomial $p$ is such a number $\alpha$ that satisfy the condition $p(\alpha) = 0$. Root $\alpha$ with multiplicity $k$ is called such a root of $p$ if exists polynomial $q(x)$ such that:
\begin{align*}
p(x) =  (x - \alpha)q(x)
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

After defining the univariate polynomial and its elementary characteristics we can define multivariate polynomial.

\chapter{Algorithm}
\section{Projection phase}
\section{Base phase}
In the base phase of our algorithm, we have to deal with the problem of computing the real roots of a univariate polynomial This problem  could be considered as the fundamental problem of computational algebra\parencite{yap2000fundamental} as well as in many applications ranging from computational geometry to quantifier elimination. 

We decided to solve this problem by implementing real root isolation with the arbitrary precision on the length of intervals. The problem of real root isolation consists of computing intervals with rational endpoints that contain exactly one real root of the polynomial.\parencite{10.1007/11841036_72}

Among many algorithms we decided to implement one based on Descartes's rule of signs together with certain Möbius transformation.

 \subsection{Requirements of Descartes's method}
 The Descartes method requirement for terminating is that input polynomial is square-free.\parencite{ganzha2005computer}
  \begin{definition}
 Given a polynomial $p$ in $R[x]$ where $R$ is a unique factorization domain, $p$ is said to be square-free if $p$ has no divisor (or factor) of multiplicity bigger than one.\parencite{Yun:1976:SDA:800205.806320}
\end{definition}

 Therefore we must ensure this condition before for Descartes's root isolation algorithm. That can be implemented by square-free factorization or polynomial factorization over rational numbers. We implemented both algorithms to see which would have better overall performance in the final implementation.

 The advantages of polynomial factorization are that it provides all the rational roots of a polynomial, which we do not have to find with Descartes's algorithm, but on the other hand, significant advantages of square-free factorization could be its time complexity. 
 
 In our implementation, we used Yun's algorithm from \citetitle{gathen_gerhard_2013} for square-free factorization and for polynomial factorization we used factorization modulo small prime followed by Hensel lifting and naive recombination. In the last chapter, we compare these two algorithms.
 
\subsection{Descartes's method for root isolation}
The advantages of this method are the simplicity of the implementation and a better theoretical upper bound for its computing time on integer polynomials against other techniques such as the Collins-Loos or Heindel's algorithms. 
 For a square-free integral polynomial of degree $n$, we obtain that time complexity of the algorithm belongs to  $O(n^6)$  \parencite{Collins:1976}
 
The basis for our algorithm is Descartes Rule of Signs
\begin{theorem}
[Descartes Rule of Signs]
  Let $p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n b_ix^i [c, d](x)$ be a non-zero polynomial than $var(b)$ exceeds the number of zeroes of p in the open interval $(c, d)$ by even non-negative integer.\parencite{ganzha2005computer} Where $var(b)$ represents then number of sign changes of $p(x)$
  \end{theorem}
  
This theorem was first mentioned in Descartes's essay The Geometry in 1637 \cite{descartes2007geometry} and later stated and proved in exact form by Gauss in 1828 \cite{gauss1828}. Nevertheless it has two interesting consequences for our algorithm. Primarily if $var(b)$ on interval $ I = (c, d)$ of polynomial $p(x)$ is zero than interval $I$ does not contain any zero of  $p(x)$ and furthermore if $var(b) = 1 $, than $I$ is isolating interval for and contains exactly one root of $p(x)$.

In order to use the consequences in our algorithm we must to know how to transform a polynomial to arbitrary interval.
For this purpose we used Möbius transformation $x \gets \frac{ax + b}{x+1}$  which maps real positive line to interval $(a, b)$. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1109-6279} Thus our function for transforming polynomial $p(x)$ is form: 
\begin{equation}
    f(p(x)) =  (x + 1)^n . p(\frac{ax + b}{x+1})
\end{equation}
The next pseudo code of algorithm $DescartesRootIsolation$ combines the  Descartes Rule of Signs theorem and transformation of the polynomial to the arbitrary interval $(a, b)$

% \chapter{Mathematical equations}
% \label{chap:matheq}
% \TeX{} comes pre-packed with the ability to typeset inline
% equations, such as $\mathrm{e}^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x$, and display
% equations, such as \[
%   \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
%   a & b \\ c & d \\
%   \end{bmatrix}^{-1} =
%   \frac{1}{\det(\mathbf{A})} \begin{bmatrix}
%   \,\,\,d & \!\!-b \\ -c & \,a \\
%   \end{bmatrix} =
%   \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix}
%   \,\,\,d & \!\!-b \\ -c & \,a \\
%   \end{bmatrix}.
% \] \LaTeX{} defines the automatically numbered \texttt{equation}
% environment:
% \begin{equation}
%   \gamma Px = PAx = PAP^{-1}Px.
% \end{equation}
% The package \textsf{amsmath} provides several additional
% environments that can be used to typeset complex equations:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item An equation can be spread over multiple lines using the
%     \texttt{multline} environment:
%     \begin{multline}
%       a + b + c + d + e + f + b + c + d + e + f + b + c + d + e +
% f \\
%       + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q
%     \end{multline}

%   \item Several aligned equations can be typeset using the
%     \texttt{align} environment:
%     \begin{align}
%               a + b &= c + d     \\
%                   u &= v + w + x \\[1ex]
%       i + j + k + l &= m
%     \end{align}

%   \item The \texttt{alignat} environment is similar to
%     \texttt{align}, but it doesn't insert horizontal spaces between
%     the individual columns:
%     \begin{alignat}{2}
%       a + b + c &+ d       &   &= 0 \\
%               e &+ f + g   &   &= 5
%     \end{alignat}

%   \item Much like chapter, sections, tables, figures, or list
%     items, equations -- such as \eqref{eq:first} and
%     \eqref{eq:mine} -- can also be labeled and referenced:
%     \begin{alignat}{4}
%       b_{11}x_1 &+ b_{12}x_2  &  &+ b_{13}x_3  &  &             &
%         &= y_1,                   \label{eq:first} \\
%       b_{21}x_1 &+ b_{22}x_2  &  &             &  &+ b_{24}x_4  &
%         &= y_2. \tag{My equation} \label{eq:mine}
%     \end{alignat}

%   \item The \texttt{gather} environment makes it possible to
%     typeset several equations without any alignment:
%     \begin{gather}
%       \psi = \psi\psi, \\
%       \eta = \eta\eta\eta\eta\eta\eta, \\
%       \theta = \theta.
%     \end{gather}

%   \item Several cases can be typeset using the \texttt{cases}
%     environment:
%     \begin{equation}
%       |y| = \begin{cases}
%         \phantom-y & \text{if }z\geq0, \\
%                 -y & \text{otherwise}.
%       \end{cases}
%     \end{equation}
% \end{enumerate}

% contain an **unordered** set of bullet points. When a bullet point
% contains multiple paragraphs, the list is typeset as follows:

%   * The first item of a bullet list

%     that spans several paragraphs,
%   * the second item of a bullet list,
%   * the third item of a bullet list.

% When none of the bullet points contains multiple paragraphs, the
% list has a more compact form:

%   * The first item of a bullet list,
%   * the second item of a bullet list,
%   * the third item of a bullet list.

% Unlike a bulleted list, a numbered list implies chronology or
% ordering of the bullet points. When a bullet point
% contains multiple paragraphs, the list is typeset as follows:

%   1. The first item of an ordered list

%      that spans several paragraphs,
%   2. the second item of an ordered list,
%   3. the third item of an ordered list.
%   #. If you are feeling lazy,
%   #. you can use hash enumerators as well.

% When none of the bullet points contains multiple paragraphs, the
% list has a more compact form:

%   6. The first item of an ordered list,
%   7. the second item of an ordered list,
%   8. the third item of an ordered list.

% Definition lists are used to provide definitions of terms. When
% a definition contains multiple paragraphs, the list is typeset
% as follows:

% Term 1

% :   Definition 1

% *Term 2*

% :   Definition 2

%         Some code, part of Definition 2

%     Third paragraph of Definition 2.

% When none of the bullet points contains multiple paragraphs, the
% list has a more compact form:

% Term 1
% :   Definition 1
% *Term 2*
% :   Definition 2

% Block quotations are used to include an excerpt from an external
% document in way that visually clearly separates the excerpt from
% the rest of the work:

% > This is the first level of quoting.
% >
% > > This is nested blockquote.
% >
% > Back to the first level.

% Footnotes are used to include additional information to the
% document that are not necessary for the understanding of the main
% text. Here is a footnote reference^[Here is the footnote.] and
% another.[^longnote]

% [^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

%     Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
% belong to the previous footnote.

%         Some code

%     The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
%     line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
%     multi-paragraph list items.

% Citations are used to provide bibliographical references to other
% documents. This is a regular citation~[@borgman03, p. 123]. This is
% an in-text citation: @borgman03\. You can also cite several authors
% at once using both regular~[see @borgman03, p. 123; @greenberg98,
% sec.  3.2; and @thanh01] and in-text citations: @borgman03 [p.123;
% @greenberg98, sec. 3.2; @thanh01].

% Code blocks are used to include source code listings into the
% document:

%     #include <stdio.h>
%     #include <unistd.h>
%     #include <sys/types.h>
%     #include <sys/wait.h>
%     // This is a comment
%     int main(int argc, char **argv)
%     {
%         while (--c > 1 && !fork());
%         sleep(c = atoi(v[c]));
%         printf("%d\n", c);
%         wait(0);
%         return 0;
%     }

% There is an alternative syntax for code blocks that allows you to
% specify additional information, such as the language of the source
% code. This information can be used for syntax highlighting:

% ``` sh
% #!/bin/sh
% fac() {
%   if [ "$1" -leq 1 ]; then
%     echo 1
%   else
%     echo $(("$1" * fac $(("$1" - 1))))
%   fi
% }
% ``````````````

% \chapter{Inserting the bibliography}
% After linking a bibliography data\-base files to the document using
% the \verb"\"\texttt{thesis\discretionary{-}{}{}setup\{bib\discretionary{=}{=}{=}%
% \{\textit{file1},\textit{file2},\,\ldots\,\}\}} command, you can
% start citing the entries. This is just dummy text
% \parencite{borgman03} lightly sprinkled with citations
% \parencite[p.~123]{greenberg98}. Several sources can be cited at
% once: \cite{borgman03,greenberg98,thanh01}.
% \citetitle{greenberg98} was written by \citeauthor{greenberg98} in
% \citeyear{greenberg98}. We can also produce \textcite{greenberg98}%
% \ or %% Let us define a compound command:
% \def\citeauthoryear#1{(\textcite{#1},~\citeyear{#1})}%
% \citeauthoryear{greenberg98}%
% . The full bibliographic citation is:
% \emph{\fullcite{greenberg98}}. We can easily insert a bibliographic
% citation into the footnote\footfullcite{greenberg98}.

% The \verb"\nocite" command will not generate any
% output\nocite{muni}, but it will insert its arguments into
% the bibliography. The \verb"\nocite{*}" command will insert all the
% records in the bibliography database file into the bibliography.
% Try uncommenting the command
% %% \nocite{*}
% and watch the bibliography section come apart at the seams.

% When typesetting the document for the first time, citing a
% \texttt{work} will expand to [\textbf{work}] and the
% \verb"\printbibliography" command will produce no output. It is now
% necessary to generate the bibliography by running \texttt{biber
% \jobname.bcf} from the command line and then by typesetting the
% document again twice. During the first run, the bibliography
% section and the citations will be typeset, and in the second run,
% the bibliography section will appear in the table of contents.

% The \texttt{biber} command needs to be executed from within the
% directory, where the \LaTeX\ source file is located. In Windows,
% the command line can be opened in a directory by holding down the
% \textsf{Shift} key and by clicking the right mouse button while
% hovering the cursor over a directory.  Select the \textsf{Open
% Command Window Here} option in the context menu that opens shortly
% afterwards.

% With online services -- such as Overleaf -- or when using an
% automatic tool -- such as \LaTeX MK -- all commands are executed
% automatically. When you omit the \verb"\printbibliography" command,
% its location will be decided by the template.

  \printbibliography[heading=bibintoc] %% Print the bibliography.

% \chapter{Inserting the index}
% After using the \verb"\makeindex" macro and loading the
% \texttt{makeidx} package that provides additional indexing
% commands, index entries can be created by issuing the \verb"\index"
% command. \index{dummy text|(}It is possible to create ranged index
% entries, which will encompass a span of text.\index{dummy text|)}
% To insert complex typographic material -- such as $\alpha$
% \index{alpha@$\alpha$} or \TeX{} \index{TeX@\TeX} --
% into the index, you need to specify a text string, which will
% determine how the entry will be sorted. It is also possible to
% create hierarchal entries. \index{vehicles!trucks}
% \index{vehicles!speed cars}

% After typesetting the document, it is necessary to generate the
% index by running
% \begin{center}%
%   \texttt{texindy -I latex -C utf8 -L }$\langle$\textit{locale}%
%   $\rangle$\texttt{ \jobname.idx}
% \end{center}
% from the command line, where $\langle$\textit{locale}$\rangle$
% corresponds to the main locale of your thesis -- such as
% \texttt{english}, and then typesetting the document again.

% The \texttt{texindy} command needs to be executed from within the
% directory, where the \LaTeX\ source file is located. In Windows,
% the command line can be opened in a directory by holding down the
% \textsf{Shift} key and by clicking the right mouse button while
% hovering the cursor over a directory. Select the \textsf{Open Command
% Window Here} option in the context menu that opens shortly
% afterwards.

% With online services -- such as Overleaf -- the commands are
% executed automatically, although the locale may be erroneously
% detected, or the \texttt{makeindex} tool (which is only able to
% sort entries that contain digits and letters of the English
% alphabet) may be used instead of \texttt{texindy}. In either case,
% the index will be ill-sorted.

%   \makeatletter\thesis@blocks@clear\makeatother
%   \phantomsection %% Print the index and insert it into the
%   \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\indexname} %% table of contents.
%   \printindex

% \appendix %% Start the appendices.
% \chapter{An appendix}
% Here you can insert the appendices of your thesis.
